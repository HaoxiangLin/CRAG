(1)Signal_hotspot_calculate.m was used to calculate the histone siganls (i.e. DNase siganls, H3K4me1 siganls etc.) around the hotspots.
For example, Signal_hotspot_calculate('E29','DNase','BH01') could be used to calculate the DNase siganls in E29 (monocyte) around the hotspots in BH01.
The output of this function is 'DNase_BH01.mat', which was saved in '/Basic_info/Histone_Signal/E29/'. In this file, there are two variables:
x-x axis value (distance to the hotspot)
y-y axis value (the average signals around the hotspots).
We can use plot(x,y) to get the figure (DNase siganls around the hotspots in BH01).

(2)To run this function, the file (Signal_hotspot_calculate.m) should be in the same floder of 'Basic_info'.
By default, the histone siganls data should be saved in 'Basic_info/Histone_Signal/'.
For example, the DNse siganls of E29 should be in the path 'Basic_info/Histone_Signal/E29/DNase/'.
In this path, there are 22 .mat files (chr1.mat, chr2.mat,...,chr22.mat), which saved the DNase siganls of the 22 chromosomes.
In each file, it contains a variable 'loc', which is a N*1 array. N is the number of bases in the current chromosome. loc(i,1) is the DNase signal in the ith bases.
Also, the hotspots should be in the corresponding path, such as 'BH01/result_n/peak_all.mat'.

If you want to calculate the histone siganls of new sample around a new hotspot file. For example, the H3K4me1 siganls of E32 around IH01. Then you should have the hotspots
file for IH01 in 'IH01/result_n/peak_all.mat', and the H3K4me1 siganls of E32 in 'Basic_info/Histone_Signal/E32/H3K4me1/chr1...chr22.mat'.
And run the function Signal_hotspot_calculate('E32','H3K4me1','IH01'), you could get the result in 'Basic_info/Histone_Signal/E32/H3K4me1_IH01.mat'.

(3)The function could be used to finish figure 3a, figure 3b and similar analysis (figure 4b).

(4)myth_signal_hotspot.m was used to calculate the DNA mythelation levels around the hotspots.
For example, myth_signal_hotspote('BH01','PNAS_healthy') could be used to calculate the DNA mythelation levels in PNAS healthy plasma sample around the hotspots in BH01.
The output of this function is 'BH01_PNAS_healthy_DNAmyth.mat', which was saved in 'Basic_info/myth_path/'. In this file, there are two variables:
x_val-x axis value (distance to the hotspot)
y_val-y axis value (the average DNA mythelation levels around the hotspots).
We can use plot(x,y) to get the figure (DNase siganls around the hotspots in BH01).

(5)To run this function, the file (myth_signal_hotspot.m) should be in the same floder of 'Basic_info'.
By default, the histone siganls data should be saved in 'Basic_info/myth_path/'.
For example, the DNse mythelation data of PNAS_healthy should be in the path 'Basic_info/myth_path/PNAS_healthy/'.
In this path, there are 22 .mat files (chr1.mat, chr2.mat,...,chr22.mat), which saved the DNase siganls of the 22 chromosomes.
In each file, it contains a variable 'loc', which is a N*1 array. N is the number of bases in the current chromosome. loc(i,1) is the DNase signal in the ith bases.
If there no DNA methelation site in the bases, the defalut value should be negative, such as -1, so as to distinguish the base is zero mythelated or without detected.
Also, the hotspots should be in the corresponding path, such as 'BH01/result_n/peak_all.mat'.
The function could be used to finish figure 4c or similar analysis.
